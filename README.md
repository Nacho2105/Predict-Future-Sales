# Predict-Future-Sales-
The business analized in this project was one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. The data of this company is open source in Kaggle and have records of sales from 2013 to 2015, there are a lot of stores, items and categories on the products :smile:

In this project we create various steps to determine health of the business analized. We used business intelligence to answer some questions of the past data, the questions that were asked were the following:

- Which categories are the most selled?
- Which articles are the most selled?
- Which stores sell the most?
- Month and sales impact
- Trend, seasonality and stationarity analysis

The next step, once stationarity was analized we decide to forecast the salesfor the next following months, so we use two approaches:

- ARMA Model, an statistical analysis of time series
- SVM model, a machine learning model for many features

This are some of the plots generated by the code:
